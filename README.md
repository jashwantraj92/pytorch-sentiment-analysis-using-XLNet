## - The Explanation is given with the code 
- XLNet is a state-of-the-art neural network designed for various NLP tasks.
- Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and Google released a new pre-trained language model called XLNet
- The previous state-of-the-art language model is BERT, which achieves a GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) score of 80.5%. GLUE is a benchmark for training, evaluating, and analyzing natural language understanding systems, and the human baseline score is 87.1%.
- pytorch transformer is used which is developed by huggingface.
